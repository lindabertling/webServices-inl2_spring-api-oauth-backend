# webServices-inl2_spring-api-oauth-backend
Spring boot application with OAuth2 using GitHub REST API.

The application.properties file has been excluded from git due to security reasons but you'll find a sample in its place:
src/main/resources/application.properties_sample

You'll need to create the proper application.properties file following the template and adding your own data for the
application to work.
